#### Installing Yarn (recommended)

We personally recommend Yarn as we think it is a better package manager than npm. If you want to use Yarn, keep in mind that you should not mix the 2. You either use Yarn or Npm in a project, never both.

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

## ğŸ“¦ Dependencies installation

To setup the template and start installing project dependencies, run one of the following commands:

```bash
# using npm v7
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# using yarn
yarn install
```

## ğŸ”ƒ Build App

To start the development server, run one of the following commands:

```bash
# using npm v7
npm run build

# using yarn
yarn build
```

## ğŸ”ƒ Run a development server

To start the development server, run one of the following commands:

```bash
# using npm v7
npm run dev

# using yarn
yarn dev
```
